MachineLrngProject
==================

This repo contains code and supporting documents for the Coursera/JHU Machine Learning course project.

The HTML is live on github pages at http://lizps.github.io/MachineLrngProject/project_report.html 

or at http://lizps.weebly.com/

Note added 9/23/2014:
After grading other papers, I realized that peer graders may expect to see my analysis code in the HTML file.
I interpreted the instructions to submit both a Rmd and an HTML to mean that the Rmd was a complete reproducible
analysis while the HTML summarized and interpreted, so you'll have to look at the Rmd to see the code.

I also reknit it with the code visible and posted to my weebly site (http://lizps.weebly.com/) if you'd prefer 
to look at HTML instead of rmd. I did not change the version on github pages. 
I am not trying to cheat, just to make it easy for you to see what you are looking for.
